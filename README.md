# Check your understanding

## 1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

- Within a Github Action that runs whenever code is pushed
- Manually run them locally before pushing code
- Run them all after all development is completed

Answer: I would fit my automated tests in for my Recipe project devdelopment pipeline within a Github Action that runs whenever code is pushed. I would do so because it makes it easier to keep track of the potential mistakes that can occur when implementing some sort of feature. This greatly decreases the chances of some bug running through the main branch and messing things up in the future.

## Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)

Answer: No, I would not.
